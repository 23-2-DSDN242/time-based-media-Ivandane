# MDDN 242 Project 1: Time-based Media  

## Sketch Explanation

I plan to have two/three circular ring-like objects in the middle of the canvas, rotating and/or expanding in length according to hours, minutes and seconds. I also want to incorporate greenery such as vines and flowers that sprout from the rings and grow outwards (depending on the time of day, month etc.), with garden insects such as butterflies, ladybugs and bees encircling the overall picture.

## Maeda Clock

I recreated the second Maeda Clock, designed by John Maeda, using a function and a grid-system to align the circles.

## Original Clock Process

## 07/03/2024

- Changed initial idea to encompass a sakura theme (based off the Aston Norwood Sakura Blossom Garden in Upper Hutt).
- Created a pond by using overlapping circles with changes in size and transparency.
- Created a branch that stretches over the pond.

## 12/03/2024

- Created a sakura blossom image to load into my project.
- Created a class that loads objects within an array depending on the current minutes.
- Used obj.hours and a variable 'oldHour' to populate the array with the correct amount of objects.
