# MDDN 242 Project 1: Time-based Media  

## Sketch Explanation

I plan to have two/three circular ring-like objects in the middle of the canvas, rotating and/or expanding in length according to hours, minutes and seconds. I also want to incorporate greenery such as vines and flowers that sprout from the rings and grow outwards (depending on the time of day, month etc.), with garden insects such as butterflies, ladybugs and bees encircling the overall picture.

## Maeda Clock

I recreated the second Maeda Clock, designed by John Maeda, using a function and a grid-system to align the circles.

## Original Clock

I changed my idea slightly and made a pond with overlapping circles, and a branch that stretches over the pond.
